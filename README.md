# AICTE-Week-Assessment-1
## Crop Recommendation System using Machine Learning
This project uses machine learning to recommend the most suitable crop to grow based on environmental and soil parameters.

## Project Structure:
Crop_recommendation.ipynb – The main Jupyter Notebook containing data preprocessing, model training (likely using classification), and predictions.
Dataset (if not embedded) – Usually contains soil and weather features like N, P, K, temperature, humidity, pH, rainfall.
Outputs – Recommended crop names (e.g., rice, maize, cotton, etc.).

## Technologies Used:
Python

Scikit-learn

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualizations)

Jupyter Notebook

## Machine Learning Model:

Likely Classification-based (e.g., Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.)

Model trained on labeled dataset to predict crop types.

## Features Used:

Nitrogen (N)

Phosphorus (P)

Potassium (K)

Temperature

Humidity

pH

Rainfall

## Use Case:

Helpful for farmers, agricultural planners, and students learning machine learning applications in agriculture.
